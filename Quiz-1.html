			<h1 style="color:darkblue";><u>About Me</u></h1>
			<hr>
				<p style="color:white";> Hi, my name is Quinn. I am a first year at ULV. I am majoring in computer science. My concentration is Engineering.Two intresting things about me is that I like to play chess and do ceramics as a hobby.</p>
			<h2 style="color:darkblue">Favorite Websites</h2>
				<p> These are my favorite websites because I only really use the internet for entertainment, therefore im usually watching shows or videos. I dont use the internet for playing many games or much of anything else. I will usually spend my time being active / not online.</p>
				<ul style="color:black" "font-size:25px";>
					<li><a href="Netflix.com"><b>Netflix</b></a> </li>
					<li><a href="Youtube.com"><b>Youtube</b></a> </li>
					<li><a href="Twitch.com"><b>Twitch</b></a> </li>
				</ul>
				
			<h2 style="color: DarkGreen "> Quotes</h2>
				<p> One of my favorite quotes is by no one specific but it really defines what I think an artist should strive for when working at their craft.</p>
					<blockquote><i>"The job of any artist is always to deepen the mystery."</i></blockquote>
				<p> Another quote that I think can be applied to many things in life again isn't by anyone specific but speaks volumes about how we get caught up on things. Or really just not having purpose in what we are doing.</p>
					<blockquote><i>"If you cannot find a reason to fight, then you shouldn't be fighting at all."</i></blockquote>
			<h2 style="color:darkblue";> Favorite Vacation Spot</h2>
				<p> I have not yet gone to the bahamas but I have been told that you can rent a very small pot of land for about a week or less that is out in the water like a small island. I would love to go out there and not see or talk to anyone for a whole week, esspecially if I have throwing wheel with me.

			<h2> Math Problem </h2>
				<p> I just like limit problems they are interesting, because they warp our perception of numbers. As in we dont actually get an answer we just get infinitely close to the answer.
				<p style="font-size: 35px";> lim <sub>x &rarr; 4</sub>=x<sup>2</sup>/x<sup>2</sup>-4x+3 </p>
			<h2> My Mood</h2>
				<p> I honestly dont even know what emoji to put as my mood... but I feel that I synergies with a tortoies, therefore an emoji of a tortoies is shown below. </p>
				<p style="font-size: 48px";> &#128034; </p>
